## L5, L6.1, L6.2

1. What do you mean by binding? what are the possible binding times?
Answer:
**Binding**: A binding is an association between an entity and an attribute, such as between a variable and its type or value, or between an operation and a symbol.
**Binding time**: is the time at which a binding takes place.
**Possible Binding times**:
    - Language design time: bind operator symbols to operations
    - Language implementation time: bind floating point type to a representation.
2. Differentiate between static and dynamic binding.
3. Differentiate between explicit and implicit binding.
